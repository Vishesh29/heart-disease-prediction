# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains medical information and test results for patients, and the goal is to accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes standard preprocessing steps, including scaling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Several machine learning models are trained, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The hyperparameters of the models are optimized using GridSearchCV, ensuring the best possible performance for each model.
- **Evaluation**: The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
